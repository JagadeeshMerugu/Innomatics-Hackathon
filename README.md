# Innomatics Internship Hackathon – Data Analysis Project 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my complete submission for the **Innomatics Internship Hackathon**, where I analyzed a real-world **food delivery dataset** to answer business-oriented questions using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

The project focuses on deriving actionable insights related to **revenue, user behavior, membership status, cuisine performance, and restaurant ratings** using Python.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The objective of the hackathon was to analyze the given dataset and answer key analytical questions such as:

* Which city generates the highest revenue?
* How does membership status (Gold users) impact revenue and order value?
* Which cuisines and restaurant rating ranges contribute the most to revenue?
* How user spending behavior varies across cities and segments

The goal was to apply EDA techniques to support **data-driven business decisions**.

## 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset represents a food delivery platform and includes information related to:

* Users and their membership status (Gold / Non-Gold)
* Orders and total order value
* Cities and locations
* Restaurant ratings
* Cuisine types

*(Dataset was provided as part of the hackathon.)*

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
* **NumPy** – Numerical analysis
* **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis

## 🔍 Approach & Methodology

1. **Data Loading & Understanding**

   * Imported datasets and reviewed structure
   * Checked shape, data types, and summary statistics

2. **Data Exploration & Preparation**

   * Explored dataset structure and variables
   * Verified data types and value distributions
   * Used the dataset as provided for analysis (no extensive cleaning or preprocessing performed)

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Revenue analysis by city and membership
   * Cuisine-wise performance analysis
   * User spending behavior analysis
   * Restaurant rating vs revenue analysis

4. **Business Question Analysis**
   Answered key questions such as:

   * Which city has the highest total revenue from Gold members?
   * Which cuisine has the highest average order value?
   * How many users spent more than ₹1000 in total?
   * Which restaurant rating range generated the highest revenue?

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* Certain cities contribute significantly higher revenue, especially from **Gold members**
* Specific cuisines show higher **average order values**, making them more profitable
* A small segment of users contributes disproportionately to total revenue
* Restaurants within a particular **rating range** generate the highest revenue
